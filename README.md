Tennis_Score App

Here you can find my project from lesson 9 (Google Developer Challenge Scholarship).
I have tried to combine and practice everything I learned in this section of the course. I make an app that allows a user to keep track of points within a game.

I have chosen a tennis game which gives a user the ability to keep track of the score of two different teams playing a game.
Play tennis and the app will keep track of everything if you just push the button of the one who scores.
It is possible that a tie occurs at 40 points, we will call that: deuce. After that, you can have the following: adv - 40 or 40 - adv.

A set will only be won:

a) The first player to have 6 games (with a difference of 2 or more);

b) Else the first player to win 7 games. The app will automatically start counting in the new set.
