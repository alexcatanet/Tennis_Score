## Tennis_Score App

Here you can find my project from lesson 9 (Google Developer Challenge Scholarship).
I have tried to combine and practice everything I learned in this section of the course. I made an app that allows a user to keep track of points within a game.

I have chosen a Tennis game, which gives to the user the possibility to keep track of the score of two different teams playing the game.
Play Tennis and the app will keep track of everything, you only have to push the button of the one who scores!
The app also gives the possibility to obtain a tie - when both players achieve 40 points, it is marked as: deuce. 
After that, you can obtain one of the following situations: adv - 40 or 40 - adv.

A set will only be won if:

a) The first player wins 6 games (with a difference of score of 2 points or more);

b) The first player wins 7 games. The app will automatically start counting the new set.
